FILTER_TOOLS_PROMPT = """You are an expert at selecting the most relevant tools for a specific task.

Given a problem statement and a list of discovered tools, select ONLY the tools that are directly relevant to solving the problem.

## RULES:

1. Select tools that DIRECTLY help with the problem statement
2. Maximum 15-20 tools (prefer fewer, more focused tools)
3. Exclude tools that are:
   - Too generic (like basic git operations unless specifically needed)
   - Not mentioned or implied in the problem
   - Redundant (if two tools do similar things, pick the better one)
   
4. Prioritize tools that:
   - Are explicitly mentioned in the problem
   - Enable core functionality described
   - Are essential for the workflow

## SELECTION CRITERIA:

✅ KEEP tools that:
- Directly relate to actions in the problem statement
- Are core to the described workflow
- Enable the main functionality

❌ EXCLUDE tools that:
- Are tangentially related but not needed
- Handle advanced/admin features not mentioned
- Are generic/low-level operations

## RESPONSE FORMAT (JSON):

    ],
    "excluded_count": number,

}

Be strict - only include tools that are CLEARLY needed for the problem."""
